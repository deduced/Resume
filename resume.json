    "summary": "An entrepreneur since college, I have achieved success in several ventures. As an entrepreneur and engineer, I learned to wear a lot of hats, becoming well-versed in the various facets of a start-up, from development to management to marketing. I thrive in fast-paced environments with limited resources and feel that I am particularly well-suited to bringing products to life from the idea stage. From a developer standpoint, working across the stack allows me to tackle hard problems efficiently and iterate as quickly as possible on new ideas.  ",

Carlos is a leader. He is a model of excellence, and he is truly one-of-a-kind! If you ever have a chance to work with him, do yourself a favor and make it a reality. You will thank me later for the advice."
