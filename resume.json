In title and position, we were peers, and Carlos went out of his way to make me feel that I was justified to consider myself his equal, but at the same time, because he is a consummate professional and extremely competent, I always found myself motivated to go above and beyond in order to live up to the standard that he sets for himself and to warrant the profound faith he has in me. Carlos is a leader. He is a model of excellence, and he is truly one-of-a-kind! If you ever have a chance to work with him, do yourself a favor and make it a reality. You will thank me later for the advice."
